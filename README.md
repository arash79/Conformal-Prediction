# Project Overview

This repository contains code for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and experimentation with conformal prediction methods for both classification and regression tasks.

## Structure

### Streamlit Dashboard

- `app.py`: A Streamlit dashboard designed for interactive exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Run the dashboard:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Jupyter Notebooks

The project includes four distinct Jupyter notebooks demonstrating conformal prediction methods:

#### Conformal Classification

- `simple_classification.ipynb`: Conformal classification without dimensionality reduction.
- `dim_red_classification.ipynb`: Conformal classification with dimensionality reduction.

#### Conformal Regression

- `simple_regression.ipynb`: Conformal regression without dimensionality reduction.
- `dim_red_regression.ipynb`: Conformal regression with dimensionality reduction.

## Requirements

Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit dashboard for initial data exploration, then explore each notebook for specific conformal prediction techniques.
